This is the intro page.

My dumb math tools
This is a collection of math tools i often use. 
This is also an example code to test the automatic building of a code documentation.


RST format
***********
These pages have to be written in `rst format <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#headings>`_,  which is very close from markdown format.


Another section
*****************

You can put code blocks in those pages:
::

    import math
    print 'import done'


You can add lists:

- one think
- second thing


Or numbered lists:

1. first thing
2. second thing
